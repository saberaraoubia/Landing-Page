this my first ever project on my own and I kept going back and forth and struggling  but man it was worth it 

at first you get motivated and as soon as you start the cold hard reality hits you , the fear of not knowing what to do staring at a blank html and css and feeling overwhelmed 
the most challenging part for me was the header section and the cards, it took me sometime to figure how to do them .
I'm sure I don't have the best css but it's a small step to getting better 
and I can't express enough how much exitment and fun i had This whole journey, it was incredible 
and oh boy when I saw the final result, was I bursting with pride and joy and for the first time I felt a sense of achievement!
nothing could be possible without the effort and the amazing job of TOP creaters and the community, and I'll be always greatfull
