In this exercise I'm going to recreate an incredibly common website layout a "landing page"
section 1 :
header centered + 10px 200px padding for both header and hero section
hero section : have the same width and padding
+ 4 cards same size only border visible same color
section 3 : text centered with extra font size and italic style
section 4 : modal card with a sign up button
footer
